var $yborrow = 'LendR is a Peer-to-Peer lending platform, which gets creditworthy borrowers and willing investors together to transact on short to medium term personal unsecured loans.<br><br>
LendR goes beyond conventional forms of risk analysis of the borrower in order to serve a broader user base. LendR takes into account 100s of data points to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower such as net salary, expenditure trends, locality of stay, educational qualification, utility and mobile bills, asset holding, Investments, Credit card bills and online spending behavior etc. This approach ensures that individuals with a less favourable conventional risk assessment are also likely to get a loan through our platform if they are credit worthy as our proprietary machine learning algorithm generates a more holistic credit profile of the borrower.<br><br>
LendR offers borrowers with the convenience to getting loans while sitting at home without having to visit a bank numerous times to sign papers and other formalities.<br><br>
We ensure that the process is completely transparent with no hidden charges levied on the borrower. LendR offers a streamlined and efficient approach to personal finance making the process a very pleasant experience for the borrowers.<br><br>
We also offer borrowers a chance to send and receive proposals from prospective investors to ensure that both parties reach a mutually beneficial arrangement.';

var $loanPurpose = 'You may avail a loan for a rent payment, school fees payment, auto finance, wedding, honeymoon or any other personal use.<br><br> 
LendR doesn&#39t contemplate any reason to be unfit to avail a loan. We at LendR don&#39t differentiate and judge the cause for which an individual is looking for a loan, other than the understandable circumstance that a person doesn&#39t use the money for any illegal or prohibited activity. One may avail loans for several purposes such as:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>For education</li>
<li>For rent or home improvement</li>
<li>Credit to pay off/consolidate ongoing loans</li>
<li>Credit for medical predicaments</li>
<li>For Weddings and other such significant occasions</li>
<li>For a Holiday</li>
<li>Mortgage for initial capital required to buy for cars, bikes etc.</li>
</ul>
These are few of our everyday life needs and this list is not exhaustive, there can be many other valid circumstances which may require an individual to avail a personal loan.';

var $rep_intRates = 'Disbursals and repayments for a loan through LendR can be done through various channels. All payment modes recognized such as Cheques, Auto Debit/Credits, NEFT, Bank transfers, Cash Cards, Mobile wallets etc. can be availed.<br><br>
The monthly installments you pay are not inclusive of fees paid to LendR. Monthly installments of Borrowers are defined as per the rate of interest settled between the investors and the borrowers. The loan installments are directly given to the investors and LendR just acts as a facilitator for the installments if the investor requests us to do so.<br><br>
<h4>Pre-payment of Loan</h4>
You can choose to make a prepayment of the entire loan amount without any penalty/ prepayment charges, pre-closure charges etc, however this has to be agreed in advance between the borrower and their respective investors.<br><br>
<h4>Non-Payment</h4>
In case you do not pay the loan installment by the due date, an additional penal interest rate as agreed between the investor and borrower will be applied to the due amount for the duration of delay which you will be liable to pay to your Investor(s). In addition to that, LendR will charge a one-off default processing charge.<br><br>
<h4>Rate of Interest</h4>
The better deal you are able to strike with the investors the lower will be your interest rate.<br>
Since, you will be receiving a loan from multiple investors, your interest rate will be a weighted average of the individual loan parts.<br><br>
<h4>Refund Policy</h4>
The eligibility of being a borrower is determined by your intention and ability to repay the loan amount. LendR reserves the right of selecting the borrowers suitable for listing on its website. All borrower applications are subject to stringent verification by LendR’s risk management team and in case an application is not found suitable then LendR reserves the right to partially refund the listing fees paid by you and terminate your loan application.<br>
In case a loan application is rejected prior to listing on the LendR portal then LendR will notify the applicant and provide the following services:
<ol>
    <li>An opportunity to register on the website and explore the platform</li>
    <li>A detailed individual credit analysis report with exact reasons for declining loan application</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h4>Risks</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Default Risk</li>
    <li>Permanent Disability</li>
    <li>Job Termination</li>
    <li>Death</li>
    <li>Diversion Risk</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Mitigants/Support</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Credit Checks</li>
    <li>Guarantor</li>
    <li>Risk Retention Fund</li>
    <li>Credit Insurance to cover: Death, Permanent Disability & Job termination</li>
    <li>Close monitoring</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Credit Checks</h4>
credit checks ascertain if customers do not have a bad loan facility with another bank or finance house. Credit bureaus update their data monthly hence enabling subscribers have accurate information.<br><br>
<h4>Guarantor</h4>
There must be a guarantor in place in case of noncompliance by the customer. A guarantor can be anyone that a borrower puts forward that is willing to guarantee the borrower’s obligations under the LendR agreement.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>They have to be in paid employment or have steady income.</li>
    <li>There annual salary or personal income should be verified to be sufficient cover over a 100% of the loan amount (suggesting 200-300%).</li>
    <li>The guarantors address should be verifiable. They must reside in Nigeria and confirmed to reside in the address they have provided.</li>
    <li>They will have to sign a Guarantor Agreement.</li>
    <li>A comprehensive credit check will be done on the guarantor and there should be no adverse report on them.</li>
    <li>If a guarantor is self employed, they must avail evidence of income.</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>Risk Retention Fund</h4>
A form of self-insurance employed by organizations which have determined that the cost of transferring a risk to an insurance company is greater over time than the cost of retaining the risk and paying for losses out of their own reserve fund. (this is doable but very technical and complicated).<br><br>
<h4>Credit Insurance</h4>
This insures credits against the customer’s death, permanent disability, job termination. The customer will bare the cost of the credit insurance. In case of the above listed unfortunate incidents the insurance company is liable to pay on the existing facility.<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Credit Insurance pays on your loan if you die or cannot work due to becoming disabled</li>
    <li>Credit Insurance pays the remainder of your loan in the event you die before the loan is repaid.</li>
    <li>It makes payments if you become sick or disabled and are unable to work.</li>
    <li>The lender is protected from losing the money you borrowed in cause of death disability or involuntary loss of employment. It provides payment of unpaid or outstanding balance in the event of death permanent disability of involuntary loss of employment</li>
    <li>Single premium payment is advised</li>
</ul>
<h4>Close Monitoring</h4>
Close monitoring will be done by the company to ensure that there is no diversion of funds. Another form of diversion is the diversion of salaries. Hence, from the 6 months account statement the customer&#39s salary date will be ascertained and a standing order will be filled so as to ensure repayment date falls on the same day as pay day.<br><br>';
